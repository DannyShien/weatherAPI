Fetching data from an Open Weather API 

## Objective
With this mini project, I built another simple weather application to test myself. I wanted to see how much I still understood about DOM manipulation, post graduation of DigitalCrafts. I am fairly pleased with the results but still have a lot to learn about different possibilities on how the logic would work out.

## Decscription
This is a simple weather application calling from the openWeatherSourse API. 
- User has an input field that they can use to search for a specific city's weather. Once the search is entered, the input value  will fetch the API and return a jSON value for that city. 
- The jSON value returns back and displays particular information such as, the city's name, weather condition, main temperature, condition icon, humidity, wind and cloudiness.
